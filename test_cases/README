DESCRIPTION OF run_tests.sh

run\_tests.sh is a testing script used to validate output of Sequel-LS.  It runs batches of commands stored in text files through both Sequel-LS and SQLite and compares the outputs.


SETTING UP THE test_cases DIRECTORY FOR USAGE OF run_tests.sh:

It is expected that there are a collection of text files in the test_cases directory named test*.txt.  (Examples: test1.txt, test01.txt, test955.txt)  The text files must contain valid SQLite statements.  

Some general advice when writing the text files:
- The scripts should begin with 'drop if exist table' commands removing any tables being used by the test to ensure no preexisting table contents.
- A single line beginning with '--- ' should be used to briefly describe the test.  This will be displayed in the test results
- Like SQLite, '--' may be used to comment out lines within the file


RUNNING run_tests.sh:

the script must be run from the root directory (where the Makefile exists).  It is called with "test_cases/run_tests.sh <database program executable>".
example: test_cases/run_tests.sh bin/Sequel-LS

A list will be displayed containing each .txt file tested, the description found within the text file, and either 'PASSED' or 'FAILED', depending on whether the outputs of Sequel-LS and SQLite matched.
